# coms4156_jumpstart
Jumpstart Project for Columbia University's COMS 4156

## Getting Started
One person will need to be "Devops" for the duration of the project (pick someone who won't drop the class.)  This person will need to own the GitHub repo and all the other tools.

ImHere is an attendance-taking app using Flask and Python 2.7.  The Wiki guides you through the installation using GitHub as the source control system, Travis CI as the continuous integration tool, and Google Cloud as the deployment environment.
